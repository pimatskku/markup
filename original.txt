Markup Language vs Programming Language

Markup languages describe document structures, enrich content for automated processing, and control presentation or formatting without executing logic or computations.

Programming languages, in contrast, provide instructions for performing logic, computations, and algorithms to manipulate and process data.

Features of Markup Languages
	•	Used for document structuring
	•	Easy formatting
	•	Human-readable
